### Issues

If you are about to create a new issue, search if a similar issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, go ahead and open an issue describing the problem. An issue could be about a bug that you discovered, a suggested change or even a discussion.

To find an issue that you want to fix, scan through the list. You may find that the `labels` are helpful in this situation. You can use them as a filter as well while searching.

### Making Changes

- To make changes to this repository, make sure to fork it and make changes to your fork locally, without harming the original project.
- It is good practice to create a different branch for different changes.
- Commit the changes you are making at every step, and make sure to add good commit messages describing the part you added/changed with that specific commit.
- When you are happy with your changes and are ready to publish them, make a pull request. We will review your suggested changes and hopefully merge them!
